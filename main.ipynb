    "### About Rcognita\n",
    "The platform for this (and all subsequent work) is [Rcognita](https://gitflic.ru/project/aidynamicaction/rcognita), a framework for applying control theory and machine learning algorithms to control problems, an integral part of which is the closed-loop interaction between the agent under control and the environment evolving over time. In the Rcognita paradigm, the main bearer of all the classes and variables needed to run the simulation is the `pipeline`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts of `pipeline` are: \n",
    "* `simulator`, which is defined at module `simulators.py` and responsible for simulation of evolution of the environment\n",
    "* `actor`, defined at module `actors.py`, which is responsible for obtaining of action\n",
    "* `critic`, defined at module `critics.py`, which is reponsible for learning of reward function and obtaining its value \n",
    "* `controller`, which is defined at module `controllers.py` and it's needed to put it all together into an RL (or other) controller\n",
    "* `system`, which is defined at module `systems.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other minor things are also declarated in the pipeline and assembled module by module up to the execution of the pipeline itself. \n",
    "Just to be on the same page, we provide some notation to prevent further confusions.\n",
    "* `weights` is the general name and for weights of neural network and for values in tables of value function and policy as well. This agreement comes from the motivation for being consistent with classical RL where critic and actor are being implemented as some neural networks with some **weights**. So, here comes the second term\n",
    "* `model`. It's obvious that parameters give specificity to something. But the general form itself is being called `model`. There are plenty of models of different types and forms (such as NN). Model is what critic and actor and even running cost always have, no matter what.\n",
    "* `predictor` - Inspite of it's cryptic name, this object performs an important function, namely, it carries the law by which the dynamics of our system is being predicted in future. For example, if we have some differential equation\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\dot{\\boldsymbol x} = \\boldsymbol f(\\boldsymbol x, \\boldsymbol u)\\\\\n",

    "\\boldsymbol x(0)=\\boldsymbol x_{0}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "where $x_{0}$ is the **initial state**.\n",
    "in general, there are several ways of prediction: \n",
    "> - **Analytical**, when we have a precise formula of analytical solution $\\boldsymbol x(t)$ to the ODE and have no problems to compute it at any given time. This is great but not that possible in real life. Nevertheless, our predictor could be expressed like:  $\\text{predictor}(\\boldsymbol x(\\tau),dt) = \\boldsymbol x(\\tau + dt)$\n",
    "> - **Numerical** way is mostly a case. The simplest way of prediction then is an Euler method:\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol x_{k+1}= \\text{predictor}(\\boldsymbol x_k, \\delta)=\\boldsymbol x_{k}+\\delta \\boldsymbol f\\left(\\boldsymbol x_{k}, \\boldsymbol u_{k}\\right) \\text {, }$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we meet a new object - **scenario**. Scenario is a module that forms and executes the main loops for different scenarios, like online or episodical scenario. In this assignment we will use an episodical scenario.\n"
